	I miss the old Shetland Pony, straight from the Go Shetland Pony 
	<br />
	Chop up the soul Shetland Pony, set on his goals Shetland Pony
	<br />
	I hate the new Shetland Pony, the bad mood Shetland Pony
	<br />
	The always rude Shetland Pony, spaz in the news Shetland Pony
	<br />
	I miss the sweet Shetland Pony, chop up the beats Shetland Pony
	<br />
	I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Shetland Pony
	<br />
	See, I invented Shetland Pony, it wasn't any Shetland Ponys
	<br />
	And now I look and look around and there's so many Shetland Ponys
	<br />
	I used to love Shetland Pony, I used to love Shetland Pony
	<br />
	I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Shetland Pony
	<br />
	What if Shetland Pony made a song about Shetland Pony
	<br />
	Called "I Miss The Old Shetland Pony"? Man, that'd be so Shetland Pony
	<br />
	That's all it was Shetland Pony, we still love Shetland Pony
	<br />
	And I love you like Shetland Pony loves Shetland Pony
